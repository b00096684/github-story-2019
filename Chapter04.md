## Chapter 4 - Eugene

Night time had arrived. Flynn rented a row boat so that he and Rapunzel could get a good view of the lanterns. The first lantern was released by the King and Queen in honour of their lost daughter, and the citizens of the Kingdom all follow suit with their own lanterns. The sight of thousands of lanterns being released is truly one to behold. Flynn takes the opportunity to share a secret with Rapunzel. Flynn Rider’s actual name is Eugene. Flattered at the trust between the two, Rapunzel presents Eugene with the crown he stole. Eugene dismisses it, as he has learned there is something he now cares about more than the crown. Rapunzel and Eugene lean in for a kiss, however Eugene spots the Stabbington Brothers from the corner of his eye. Terrified of the possibility of them hurting Rapunzel, he docks the boat and takes the crown with the intention of giving it to the brothers as an apology. Having no interest in the crown, the brothers begin attacking Eugene, keeping their deal with Gothel in mind. The brothers knocked Eugene unconscious, tied him to a second boat and sent it back towards the Kingdom with the crown visibly aboard. The brothers then advance towards Rapunzel, telling her Eugene was fleeing with the crown and implying they are going to abduct Rapunzel. Terrified, she runs away. Behind her, Rapunzel hears two thuds. Turning around, she sees Gothel standing over the Stabbington brothers with a large branch in hand that she used to knock them out. Rapunzel cries and finds solidarity in her mother, who was beginning to rapidly age due to not being exposed to Rapunzel’s magic hair in 36 hours. The two began the journey back to the tower.

Back at the Kingdom, the horse notices Eugene’s unconscious body return to the dock without Rapunzel. Eugene drifts towards a group of guards who notice the stolen crown and capture Eugene. Knowing something must have happened to Rapunzel, the horse flees back to the pub to get reinforcements. The sentence is clear; Eugene is to be executed. Rapunzel and Gothel return home. Distraught by Eugene betraying her and leaving her, Rapunzel begins to have a breakdown. She has flashbacks of her day in Corona. She once again sees the mural. The mural manages to trigger a memory deep inside Rapunzel. She sees herself as a baby. Long, blonde hair even as a newborn. Rapunzel sees the King and Queen of Corona and all the pieces connect themselves: Rapunzel is the lost princess. Upon this realisation, Rapunzel confronts Gothel. Rapunzel figured it all out. Gothel stole her as a baby so that Gothel could hold the secret to eternal life. Knowing her secrets were exposed, Gothel chains up Rapunzel, with intention of keeping her locked up forever.

The day of Eugene’s execution had arrived. Eugene had noticed the Stabbington Brothers in a cell on his escorted walk to the guillotine. “Where’s Rapunzel?!” he demanded to know. Sideburns Stabbington replied to him “The mother tricked us.” As the walk to the guillotine continued, the cavalry from the pub who made friends with Eugene and Rapunzel had arrived with the horse. Eugene managed to escape his execution and hopped on the horse, running swiftly to Rapunzel’s tower. When Eugene arrived, he asked Rapunzel to let down her hair. She did, and Eugene climbed up. When he reached the top and climbed inside, he was immediately stabbed by Gothel. Falling over, he broke a mirror in the process, leaving shards of glass all over the floor. Rapunzel managed to ungag herself and promised Gothel that she would not resist her imprisonment if she can just use her hair to heal Eugene. Reluctantly, Gothel agreed. Rapunzel crawled toward Eugene’s near-lifeless body. Ready to perform her healing song, Eugene made a swift move. Eugene grabbed a shard of glass and slashed Rapunzel’s hair with it, cutting it and neck length. Rapunzel’s hair turned a dark brown colour, and Gothel let out a shriek. Before she could do anything to retort, Gothel had aged so rapidly that she faded to dust. Seemingly powerless to stop Eugene’s bleeding, Rapunzel began to cry and life faded from her dying love. A teardrop landed on Eugene’s skin, which sent golden shockwaves throughout his body, healing him. Eugene was saved, and Rapunzel was free from Gothel’s control.
