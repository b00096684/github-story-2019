## Chapter 3 - The Kingdom of Corona

Flynn and Rapunzel had managed to escape the guards for the time being. The two found a secluded spot to set up camp for the night. During their frantic escape from the guards, Flynn had cut his hand open on a sharp stone wall. Knowing about her hair’s mystical properties, Rapunzel whispered to Flynn “Don’t freak out.” Rapunzel wrapped a small section of her hair around Flynn’s hand and began to sing:

*Flower, gleam and glow*

*Let your power shine*

*Make the clock reverse*

*Bring back what once was mine*

*Heal what has been hurt*

*Change the fates' design*

*Save what has been lost*

*Bring back what once was mine...*

*What once was mine*

Rapunzel’s hair began to glow a majestic bright gold. Flynn was speechless. When the song was complete, and her hair stopped glowing, Rapunzel removed her hair from Flynn’s hand. To his surprise, Flynn’s hand was fully healed. Shocked and a little bit frightened, this marked the first time Flynn was truly left in awe at Rapunzel. The two went to sleep shortly thereafter.

Flynn awoke to the horse from the Kingdom of Corona that had been tracking him for the past day standing above him, staring him down. Before the horse could attack, Rapunzel managed to calm it, convincing it that Flynn is harmless, and all Rapunzel wants is to see the lanterns, the ceremony for which begins tonight. Reluctantly, the horse calms on Flynn and takes the two to the Kingdom of Corona. In the Kingdom, Rapunzel learns of the purpose of the Lantern Festival. The Lanterns had been released every year on this date, as it marked the birthday of the lost Princess of Corona, who was stolen from her crib nearly 18 years ago. A group of young girls braiding each other’s hair see Rapunzel’s long locks and cannot resist the temptation. They put Rapunzel’s hair in a multi-layered French braid, making it so Rapunzel doesn’t have to carry her hair in her arms anymore.

Rapunzel sees a mural on a wall in the city. The mural is of the King, Queen and missing Princess of Corona. The King and Queen are dressed regally, and the baby has long, bright blonde hair. Rapunzel is dragged into a dance in the middle of town. As she is enjoying herself, she invites Flynn to dance with her. Flynn passes with a head shake but is pushed into the crowd by the horse. Flynn and Rapunzel dance together, their bond growing closer in the process.
