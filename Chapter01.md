## Chapter 1 - Rapunzel and Flynn Rider


It was a beautiful Spring day. Rapunzel, who her whole life was forced to stay indoors by her mother, was as eager as always to step outside her home and bask in the beauty of nature. However, Rapunzel's mother, Gothel,  didn't see it this way. To keep her child safe, Gothel had told her the outside was too dangerous, and forbid her from leaving home. Not knowing any better, Rapunzel trusted her mother's judgement. "Mother knows best," Rapunzel had been told her whole life, "Mother knows best..."

At 8AM, a thief called Flynn Rider, a handsome, cocky man, had broken into a castle to steal the treasure inside. He was accompanied by his twin lackies, The Stabbington Brothers. Flynn stood atop the castle, in awe at the beauty of the land. "Someday.." Flynn conversed with himself, "I'll have a castle like this of my own." The treasure the thieves were after was the precious crown belonging to the lost princess of the Kingdom of Corona. Flynn had smoothly stolen the treasure and fled, leaving the Stabbington Brothers to be captured by the guards. However, Flynn was being tracked by a single horse who was following his scent.

Rapunzel heard her mother call from the bottom of their home, a tower standing over 40 meters tall. Gothel had never allowed Rapunzel to cut her hair, as it had mystical properties that allowed Gothel to stay young forever. Rapunzel lowered her hair from the top of the tower down to the ground, allowing Gothel to step on and be raised up. Rapunzel told Gothel that for her birthday, Rapunzel wanted to see the lanterns that are lit and sent to the sky every year on her birthday. Gothel denied the request, and told Rapunzel to never ask her to go outside again. Rapunzel was upset by this, and Gothel left again.<br><br>
