## Chapter 2


During his escape, Flynn had stumbled upon Rapunzel's tower. Desperate to lose the horse that was chasing him, Flynn climbed the tower and found his way into Rapunzel's bedroom. Rapunzel hid when she heard noise outside and managed to stay hidden long enough to get behind Flynn and hit him in the back of the head with a frying pan, knocking him out. Rapunzel used her hair to tie Flynn to a chair. When Flynn awoke, he tried to charm Rapunzel into letting him go. Rapunzel however was stubborn, and told Flynn that she would let him go and give the stolen crown back to him if he agreed to chaperone Rapunzel to the Kingdom to see the lanterns. Flynn reluctantly agreed.

With this, Rapunzel finally had the confidence to step outside the tower. Her feelings were mixed. On one hand, she was excited to be outside in the beauty of nature, free to run around without walls or constraints. On the other hand, Rapunzel had disobeyed her mother and felt great guilt over this. Flynn tried to smooth talk his way out of the deal, offering to take Rapunzel home so he can leave with the crown and she can live her life without her mother ever knowing she left the tower. Rapunzel refuses. In a second attempt to take Rapunzel home, Flynn takes her to a pub for rogues and criminals on the way to the Kingdom. Rapunzel ends up befriending the thugs as she gets them to sing about their dreams.

Guards from the Kingdom of Corona arrive at the pub with the horse that had been tracking Flynn. Walking nearby, Gothel notices the commotion at the pub and takes a look. She is horrified to see Rapunzel out of the tower. One thug from the pub shows Flynn and Rapunzel a secret exit, which they use to escape the guards searching for Flynn. However, it did not take long for the horse to get Flynn's scent, and the secret exit was uncovered. Threatened that her secret to eternal life may be compromised, Gothel demanded to know the exit point of the secret exit. On her way to the other side, Gothel overheard the Stabbington Brothers discussing Flynn and the woman he was with. Recognising the description of the woman as Rapunzel, Gothel recruited the Stabbington Brothers as she could help them get back the crown and get their revenge on Flynn.
